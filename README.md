  what is Wireframes
?

<p> Wireframing is a UX designers approach that enables them to develop and organize the information of their design for a website, app or product. it is an excellent way to understand how a user interacts with your interface, by placing buttons and menus on the diagrams.

Some people like to design wireframes by their own hand, others like adopting Invision or Balsamiq software to build their own. However, most often the decision to use online tools or wireframes by hand and the process used to reach wireframe to code is less linked by the UX designer’s individual preferences and more linked with the approach required in the 
particular situation.</p>

 How can we creat wireframes
?

<p> -Do your research. <p>
<p> -Prepare your research for quick reference.<p>
<p> -Ensure that you are mapping out your user flow.<p>
<p> -Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.<p>
<p> -Add some detail and get testing.<p>
<p> -Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.</p>


<h1> 2-HTML Basics
</h1>

<p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that defines the structure of your web page and the content. For instance, content may be structured in a number of paragraphs, a list of points or by the use of pictures and data table. It consists of a series of elements.</p>

<h1> 3- Semantics
</h1>

<p> 
In programming language theory, semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. ... Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language.</p>

<header>
benefits from writing semantic markup:

<p> -Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page’s search rankings.<p>
<p> -Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.<p>
<p> -Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes.<p>
<p> -Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.<p>
